# 3D Amusement Park

## Goal

This project served as my introduction to 3D modeling of objects and the many features of OpenGL. The entry point for this project was skeleton code that constructed a small virtual space consisting of a grassy square with a roller coaster track running around it. I then added new objects and new perspectives into this space. This process included:
- Added a "Skytower" into the space, texture mapped onto  it, and provided a POV enabling the user to look out from the skytower.
- Added a "fun house" into the space and texture mapped onto it
- Added an entry sign into the park and textured mapped onto it 
- Added trees into the space, texture mapped onto the trees, and used parametric instancing to generate trees of different shapes and sizes.
- Developed a viewing mode where the user can "ride" the rollercoaster

## To Use

To run the project, it must be opened with Microsoft Office Visual Studio in a Windows environment.
